# TITANIE

Titanie is a ML model built to predict the survival rate of a passenger on the titanic. 

#### Libraries Used 
1. [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2. [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
3. [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
4. [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
5. [Decision Tree Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
6. [Sci-kit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

#### Dataset Used 

The dataset was fetched from kaggle. It was then explored using various EDA principles and also pre-processed for refinement.

#### EDA on Dataset 

Given the massive influence of data on building any AI model, the dataset was first analyzed and pre-processed before fitting it into the AI model for training. The entire refinement can be viewed in the the python notebook.

#### CART Classifier Model 

After the sucessfull refinement of the dataset, the pre-procesed data was saved as [ReadyToTrain.csv](https://github.com/prakriti42/TITANIE/blob/main/ReadyToTrain.csv) and used to build the [CART Model](https://github.com/prakriti42/TITANIE/blob/main/CART%20Classifer.ipynb).
